# FPGA Pong Game
This 2-player Pong game was programmed on a Nexys A7-100T using the MicroBlaze module in Xilinx Vivado SDK (written in C)
Player inputs are taken from the on-board switches, and the output is displayed on a monitor through VGA

The full Vivado system diagram is included in the repo
