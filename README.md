# FPGA Pong Game
This 2-player Pong game was programmed on a Nexys A7-100T using the MicroBlaze module programmed in Xilinx Vivado SDK (written in C), with other VHDL modules.
Player inputs are taken from the on-board switches, and the output is displayed on a monitor through VGA. There are 4 game speeds, which can be changed at any time, and the game can be paused.

The full Vivado system diagram is included in the repo.
